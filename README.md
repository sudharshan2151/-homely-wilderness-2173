With our  efforts and the technology that we have learned in Unit-2 in the Masai School, we were able to creatr the website in 5 days with the same looking and some features.

### End Notes ðŸ“‘

In this project we have tried to achieve like the  original design as much as possible. This entire journey of this Unit-2 construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved by dom manipulation.

### Limitations

Pages are not fully responsive yet, those pages might not be properly visible on small screen devices as we were given only 5 days to clone the website.
